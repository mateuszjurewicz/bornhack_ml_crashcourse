# Machine Learning Crash Course | Bornhack 2019
## Introduction
This repository contains the code, slides and references for a 45 minute presentation delivered at the Bornhack 2019 conference. 

This readme is meant as a **one-stop shop for finding your way into the world of Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence**. 

You may be entirely new to the worlds of data science, data engineering and software development. That's ok, you're in the right place. This document's job is to direct you to the right resources such as:

* MOOC courses
* techniques, algorithms & libraries
* tools, books, articles 

and even organizations, events and groups of like-minded people within the world of ML that may be of interest to you, depending on which branch of ML / AI caught your eye.
